# Line follower project

This repository holds the source code of my line follower project, which I made as a simulation for Robotics class.
The simulation is started by building both packages included here and launching the simulation package, but I do not guarantee that these copied directories work properly when this is done.
More information is in the final project report.
The code in this repository is intended to act more like a reference that goes along with the final project report rather than something runnable.
